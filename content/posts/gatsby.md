Gatsby is a free and open source framework based on React that helps developers build blazing fast websites and apps. 

Gatsby.js is a PWA (Progressive Web App) generator. You get code and data splitting out-of-the-box. Gatsby loads only the critical HTML, CSS, data, and JavaScript so your site loads as fast as possible. Once loaded, Gatsby prefetches resources for other pages so clicking around the site feels incredibly fast.

Gatsby.js builds your site as “static” files which can be deployed easily on dozens of services.
